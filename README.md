# Spotify Clone with Flutter

This is a simple Spotify clone application built using Flutter. The app mimics the basic features of the Spotify platform, allowing users to explore music, play tracks, and browse through playlists. The music files are stored and managed using Firebase.

## Features

- **User Interface**: A clean and responsive design similar to the Spotify app.
- **Search**: Search for songs, albums, and playlists.
- **Music Player**: Play, pause, and skip tracks.
- **Navigation**: Navigate between different sections like Home, Search, Library, and Now Playing.
- **Audio Streaming**: Integrates with Firebase Storage to stream music files.
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign in via Firebase Authentication (optional).
- **Firestore Database**: Store and retrieve music data (e.g., track details, album information) from Firestore.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: Framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Dart**: Programming language used with Flutter.
- **Firebase**: Cloud platform for storing music files (Firebase Storage), managing user authentication (Firebase Auth), and storing metadata (Firestore).
- **Bloc**: State management solution for Flutter.
